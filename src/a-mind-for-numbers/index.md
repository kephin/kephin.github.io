# A Mind for Numbers

10 Rules of Good Studying:

1. _Use recall_

After you read a page, look away and recall the main ideas. Highlight very little. An ability to recall to generate the ideas from inside yourself is one of the key indicators of good learning.

2. _Test yourself_

On everything. All the time.

3. _Chunk your problems_

Chunking is understanding and practicing with a problem solution so that it can all come to mind in a flash.

4. _Space your repetition_

Spread out your learning in any subject a little every day. Your brain can handle only a limited amount of exercise on one subject at a time.

5. _Alternate different problem-solving techniques during your practice_

Never practice too long at any one session using only one problem-solving technique. Mix it up and work on different types of problems. This teaches you both how and when to use a technique.

After every assignment and test, go over your errors, make sure you understand why you made them, and then rework your solutions.

To study most effectively, handwrite (don’t type) a problem on one side of the paper and the solution on the other.

Another way to do this is to randomly flip through your book, pick out a problem, and see whether you can solve it cold.

6. _Take breaks_

When you get frustrated with a math or science problem, take a break so that another part of your mind can take over and work in the background.

7. _Use explanatory questioning and simple analogies_

Whenever you are struggling with a concept, think to yourself, How can I explain this so that a ten-year-old could understand it? Using an analogy really helps, like saying that the flow of electricity is like the flow of water.

Don’t just think your explanation—say it out loud or put it in writing. The additional effort of speaking and writing allows you to more deeply encode (that is, convert into neural memory structures) what you are learning.

8. _Focus_

Turn off all interrupting beeps and alarms on your phone and computer, and then turn on a timer for twenty-five minutes.

9. _Eat your frogs first_

Do the hardest thing earliest in the day, when you are fresh.

10. _Make a mental contrast_

Post a picture or words in your workspace to remind you of your dream.
